# DND-UI-java
(work in progress). UI for playing dungeons and dragons. 

Designed to digitally keep track of dnd adventures.

Possible plans for future:
  -finishing feature that saves the state so it may be recalled later
  -implementing dynamic tracking
  -implementing socket for multiplayer interaction

*Update*
Due to no one wanting to hire a jack of all trades in software development I am, for the time being going to put a halt on this project
to master a tech stack that better suits my ambitions of AI robotic development in the future. Dndbeyond also has a vastly better UI than I can produce as a sole engineer at this time, but I will surely return to this project, most likely I will convert it to a the new tech stack I will be using in my spare time.
